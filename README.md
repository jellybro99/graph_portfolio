# My Portfolio

This is a project to showcase my developments and how they are related to each other through nodes on a graph.

- Hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://jellybro99.github.io/graph_portfolio)

## About the project

This is a react app styled with tailwind. It uses the [ForceGraph2d](https://github.com/vasturiano/react-force-graph/tree/master) library to create a map of all my personal projects along with how they relate to each other through things like programming languages.
